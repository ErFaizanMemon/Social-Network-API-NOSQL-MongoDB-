# Social-Network-API--NOSQL-MongoDB

    Social Network API using NoSQL MongoDB

## Description

This project is a social media startup that aims to provide an API for a social network using a NoSQL database. The primary motivation behind this project is to create a scalable and efficient backend system capable of handling large amounts of unstructured data, such as user profiles, posts, reactions, and friendships. By using a NoSQL database like MongoDB and implementing a well-structured API, this project addresses the challenge of managing and retrieving data in a social network application.
